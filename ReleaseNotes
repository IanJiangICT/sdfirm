        not working properly.
3. SCSI: scsi functions are completed for a MSD device.
4. Time: There is a plan adding interrupt context timers to meet some
         protocol's realtime requirements.  Though this has not been done in
         this revision, other functionalities may be enough for those without
         such requirments.

        not implemented in the firmware, DFU mode is not functioning in the
