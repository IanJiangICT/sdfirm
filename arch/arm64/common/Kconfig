	  The Debug Communications Channel, DCC, is a channel for passing

	  The DCC provides a communications channel between:
	  * An external debugger, described as the debug host.
	  * The debug implementation on the PE, described as the debug
	    target.
	  The DCC can be used:
	  * As a 32-bit full-duplex channel.
	  * As a 64-bit half-duplex channel.
	  The DCC is an essential part of Debug state operation and can
	  also be used in Non-debug state.
