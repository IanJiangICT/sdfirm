This folder only contains necessary drivers to demonstrate a minimal
sdfirm running on QDF2400 IMC CPU (Cortex A-53 ARM64 processor):
1. ARM generic timer (implemented by QDF2400 global counter)
2. QDF2400 BAM uart controller
3. ARM generic interrupt controller (implemented by QDF2400 GICv2
   controller)
4. QDF2400 peripheral clock controller
5. QDF2400 top level module multiplexer
6. QDF2400 EMAC controller
So that developers can derive from them to implement their own ARCH/MACH
code to boot their own ARM64 system.
This folder doesn't ensure fully functional QDF2400 system, especially the
functionalties that are required for QDF2400 APC CPUs (HMSS, or Cortex A-57
ARM64 processors). In order to extend sdfirm to create a system software
that can run full QDF2400 functionalities, please buy Qualcomm server chips
and use Qualcomm createpoint website for technical supports.
