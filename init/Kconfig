config EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "Prompt for development"
	help
	  Some of the various things that SDFirm supports can be in a state
	  of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
	  testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
	  known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
	  currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
	  uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
	  avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
	  testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
	  may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
	  in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
	  with the kernel internals are usually welcomed by the developers
	  This option will also make obsoleted drivers available. These are
	  drivers that have been replaced by something else, and/or are
	  scheduled to be removed in a future kernel release.
	  Unless you intend to help test and develop a feature or driver that
	  falls into this category, or you have a situation that requires
	  using these features, you should probably say N here, which will
	  cause the configurator to present you with fewer choices. If
	  you say Y here, you will be offered the choice of using features or
	  drivers that are currently considered to be in the alpha-test phase.

config CC_OPT_SIZE
	bool "Optimize for size"
	default y
	help
	  Enabling this option will pass "--opt-code-size" instead of
	  "--opt-code-speed" to sdcc resulting in a smaller kernel.
	  If unsure, say N.

config CC_GEN_DEBUG
	bool "Compile with debug info"
	help
	  Say Y here if you wish to examine internals while applets are
	  running.  This increases the size of the binary considerably, and
	  should only be used when doing development.  If you are doing
	  development and want to debug, answer Y.
	  Most people should answer N.
