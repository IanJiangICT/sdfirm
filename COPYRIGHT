This software contains source code developed by Lv "ZETALOG" Zheng during
his career. These source files may contain source code somewaht looks
"LIKE" an open source implemnetation. But surely, they have been modified
or completely re-written into "ZETALOG" own style.

As an engineer working in a nation that has many offshore software
development jobs, "ZETALOG" may have to hop between many local commercial
companies. In order to avoid re-creating wheels (some data structure
implementation, some OS basic concept implementation) in such an industry
chain to assure the efficiency that "ZETALOG" may be required to provide in
his new career roles, these files have to retain the ability for being
re-used by "ZETALOG" across all companies that hire him. In the other word,
"ZETALOG" has to convince his new employers that these files can be
re-licensed to any of their expected license without the worry about the
copyrights that may still be claimed by his previous employer. These source
files are hence released under a special license known as "ZETALOG"
license.

The "ZETALOG" license basically GPLv2, with one exception.
1. When the source code in this project is used and re-used by a company or
   an individual that has nothing to do with ZETALOG's business, the
   project and its souce code can be simply considered released under
   GPLv2.
2. When the source code in this project is used and re-used by a company or
   an individual that has business including but not limited to "hiring
   ZETALOG", "launced by ZETALOG", etc., with "ZETALOG", the project and
   its source code can be considered released under the special "ZETALOG"
   terms.

"ZETALOG" is not a legal person, so the words in the "ZETALOG" terms may
not be sufficiently clear to explain what a company or an individual should
be aware of when they consider to import "ZETALOG" licensed software to
their business. The following tries to explain "ZETALOG" terms in a simple
way:
1. The company or the individual can re-license this project and its source
   code into any expected license without informing "ZETALOG". However,
   when the source code is going to be published as open source, it has to
   be re-licensed to "ZETALOG" license.
2. "ZETALOG" has the right to keep some source code related to the
   technology owned by the company or the individual in an open source
   style to make sure this project can demonstrate its ability to run the
   hardware created on top of that technology. Such souce code is only
   limitted to those components that are required to boot this project
   (clock, gpio, power, uart, timer) or can be found open source
   implementations in the community. Be aware that the company and the
   individual always has the right to ask "ZETALOG" to stop publishing what
   has violated this term.
So the "ZETALOG" terms are just an example double-win terms:
1. If you want to freely use this software, please hire "ZETALOG, which
   also means you have bought the entire career accumulation of ZETALOG.
2. When you stop hiring "ZETALOG", please don't bother that "ZETALOG" may
   use same career skills demonstrated in this project to other his
   employers.
The above can be considered a fair employment terms between the employer of
"ZETALOG" and "ZETALOG". You didn't buy the entire life of "ZETALOG", you
shouldn't stop "ZETALOG" from using his career skills to earn a living.
3. If you want to freely use this software, please open source the least
   boot requirement to contribute it.
4. Since everything should have already known in the community and are only
   related to boot the "sdfirm", there is nothing you can potentially lose.
   On the contrary, you'll have an additional open source community
   solution and you'll automatically become an invester of this software.
The above can be considered a fair software usage terms between sdfirm and
who uses it. You want to import sdfirm, then do not try to conceal the fact
that sdfirm has the new user. And let sdfirm to expand its influenceship so
that you can also gain benefits from the others contributors.
