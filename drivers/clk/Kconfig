config DW_PLL5GHZ_TSMC12FFC_RANGE2
	bool "Enable range 2 preference"
	help
	  For 4G-5G range output frequency, both range2 (vco_mode=1) and
	  range 3 (low_freq=1) can match. By default, range 3 is preferred
	  due to lower jitter (high current => lower jitter), however,
	  range 2 can also be preferred due to lower comsuption.
	  If unsure, say 'N'.

config DW_PLL5GHZ_TSMC12FFC_GEAR
	bool "Enable fast startup transition"
	help
	  From Power-down to Normal operation the PLL can transition by a
	  Fast Startup (gear) state when the gear_shift pin is high, or by
	  a Slow Startup state when the gear_shift pin is low. The big
	  difference between fast and slow startups is the time required
	  to lock the phase of the loop (SPO). Fast PLL locking is achieved
	  at the cost of less phase margin and more jitter during the gear
	  state.

config DW_PLL5GHZ_TSMC12FFC_PRSTDUR
	bool "Enable preset duration adjustment"

config DW_PLL5GHZ_TSMC12FFC_ACCEL
	bool "Enable acceleration for emulation"
	depends EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  In emulation environment, t_pwrstb, t_trst and t_pwron can be
	  omit to accelerate emulation.
