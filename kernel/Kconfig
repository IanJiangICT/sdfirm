	  No hardware interrupt handlers will be registered, all hardware

	  firmware.

config SYS_POLL
	bool "Polling states with various IRQs"
	help
	  Hardware interrupt handlers will be registered, while some
	  hardware events will still be implemented in synchronous way.
	  This is a suitable architecture for those firmwares that would
	  expect faster process of interrupts and the firmware itself
	  does not require high resolution realtime responsiveness.

config SYS_POLL_RT

	help
