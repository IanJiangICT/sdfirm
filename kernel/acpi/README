The sdfirm ACPI implementation is written to offer Windows kernel modules
to dump ACPI tables (acpimon) and an GUI utility to view the dumped tables
(winacpi).

In the future, this software might be extended to be able to execute ACPI
control methods and help to build binaries running in EFI shells.  Thus
the code that might also be able to be used by firmwares are put in this
folder.

This folder contains source code that is totally rewritten during my spare
time while the interface of this software (header files) is copied from
Linux kernel so that in the future it might be possible for this software
to act as a replacement of ACPICA in the OSPMs that have already adopted
with ACPICA to offer a real test environment for this implementation.
