	help
	  A card is identified by its CID number. This method requires the
	  card to have an unique CID number. To ensure uniqueness of CIDs
	  the CID register contains 24 bits (MID and OID fields) which are
	  defined by the MMCA.
	  This option needs to be enabled in order to have more CID
	  register fields saved by sdfirm during rumtime. Be aware that
	  these fields are still used for debugging purpose and not for
	  improving the uniqueness of CIDs.
	  If unsure, say 'N'.

config MMC_ASYNC
	bool "Enable asynchronous mode support"
	help
	  By default, do not use handshake signals (STB, ACK) but polling
	  the state (busy/not busy), which is known as synchronous mode.
	  This option allows sdfirm to enable asynchronous mode via the
	  handshake signals.
